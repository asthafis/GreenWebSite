Green website to reduce carbon emmision by internet


              #Zero Carbon Website

Project Idea - 

* As a team we are working on idea to create Zero carbon website , to reduce internet carbon emission. This is a very sustainable idea in long run. As we know that today’s enviornment everybody is relying on internet so much . the internet has a very real environmental impact, even if we can’t see it.

* Energy consumption and emissions from the internet are huge. Electricity is the lifeblood of the internet, being used to power data centers, telecommunications networks, and the devices that we use to surf the web. In total, the global internet uses more electricity than the whole of the United Kingdom (416.2 terawatt hours of electricity per year to be precise).

* This translates into a lot of carbon emissions. In fact, 2% of global carbon emissions come from the electricity used by the internet. Such as data centers used by big corporations. That’s equivalent to the amount of carbon from the global aviation industry, which most people think is one of the worst polluting industries. To put it in perspective, if the internet was a country, it would be the sixth worst polluter in the world, equivalent to Germany.

* So we are working on idea to finding ways by which we can reduce carbon emission by websites  by following some steps , so It will turn helping us to make more impact online and achieve a better return on our investment. A low carbon web is a true win-win-win for website owners, web users, and the environment.

Project Roadmap for Future :-  

* In Future We can extend this idea for complex web sites which produce very high carbon emission. 

* We can create a centeralized repository from where people can make their web sites optimize. So, by using a Centeralized Resource a common frame work can be used for green web site process.
It will save time for different users who can make their website according to their understanding and then by using some common optimization technique we can fulfill requirement of a large number of users.
